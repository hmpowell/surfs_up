# Surfs Up

## Overview of the Analysis

W. Avy wants to potentially open a surf shop in conjunction with an ice cream business; however, he is concerned that it might not be sustainable year round. He wants to make sure that the temperature trends in Oahu in both June and December are high enough that both seasons will allow him to make a profit.

## Results

Here are some results from the statistics of this study:
- The mean temperature in December is 71 degrees, while the mean temperature in June is almost 75 degrees.
- The minimum temperature in December is 56 degrees, while the minimum temperature in June is 64 degrees.
- The highest temperature in December is 83 degrees, while the highest temperature in June is 85 degrees.

The full statistics can be seen below:

## Summary

In looking at the results of our analysis, the mean temperature in December is not that much lower than it is in June. Four degrees would not be a large difference in whether or not someone would want to be out and surfing or getting ice cream. In addition, the highest temperatures are not that much different, with only a 2 degree separation between the maximums for the months. The minimum temperature has the largest variation between the two months with 8 degrees difference. 

Two other calculations that might be useful are to break the temperatures per month up further by doing temperatures per month per year. This would allow us to see how climate change might affect the differences in temperatures on a greater scale. We might also want to graph the temperatures for each month to see, visually, how many times each temperature was recorded for each month. This would give us better insight into how the seasons look. In addition to the temperature, it would be useful to look at the precipitation data to determine how many days it rained, as well. This would have an impact on whether or not people are coming to enjoy the surf, and potentially, the ice cream part of the shop, also.
